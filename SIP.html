		<h2>WHAT IS COMPOSTING?</h2>
		<p>
			When organic materials (in our case, nuts/grains, banana peels, and grass clippings) decay properly, you can generate compost. It is a nutrient rich substance that can be used to achieve better soil and faster plant growth.
		</p>
		<p>
			By composting, therefore providing an optimal environment for beneficial microbes to proliferate, the decaying process actually becomes highly life-giving. Compost contains a variety of helpful bacteria that aerate and enrich the soil. Adding compost to the soil increases the amount of water that can permeate the soil because compost may hold 5â€“20 times its own weight in water. Plant roots will produce carbohydrates from their roots to entice and feed the soil microbes in order to maintain these companions' presence.
		</p>

   <div class="grid2">
		<h2> WHICH PLANT ARE WE GOING TO USE? </h2>
		<p> 
			For our plant, we are going to use the <b> Lettuce (Lactuca Sativa)</b> from te plant family Asteraceae. We chose this plant because it is easy to grow meaning it is an easy plant to see results from. It can survive mostly harsh weathers, and can be just planted directly into the soil. However, we must also always keep our awareness regarding the temperature that surrounds the plant, because it's growth can vary depending on it. 
		</p>
		<p>
			It will require to have the proper soil for growth, as well as a healthy amount of water at least twice a week so we can see faster results. Of course, all of this will be aided by our compost. Our compost will contain  a healthy balance of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Of course we can't just use any kind of compost. So after some research, we found that grass clippings, banana peels maybe with light amounts of wood ash, and many kinds of nuts and grain. Based on our research moist and green organic matter tend to have more Nitrogen than Carbon so grass clippings are a cheap and perfect fit for this.

		<H2>HOW WILL WE MAKE THE COMPOST?</H2>
		<p>
			Sourcing and creating our compost with the materials that we chose isn't exactly hard. First we need to collect our compost ingredients namely nuts/grains, banana peels, and grass clippings. Place it all in a bag and mix it, making sure that oxygen can get in to the mixture and open every few days to make sure that its mixed properly. We will also need to make sure that it is set in a temperature it can survive in and cut it up into tinier pieces before placing it in with the compost. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Once that procedure is done, we will need to place it with the soil. Make sure there are no clots in the dirt and that the temperature is just right. Create a whole just a quarter of an inch deep so you can place the seedling(s) in and water it for a set period of time or when the soil seems quite dry. We will have 3 backup sets just in case the experimental setups go awry. 
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="grid">
		<H2>OBSERVATIONS, OUTCOMES</H2>
		<p>
			Once all the foundations of using our compost and placing the seedling in is done, we will need to measure and understand what is happening with the plant. We will conduct a daily check-up and maintenance on the plant and take note of any new happenings that might have happened or will possible happen to our plant. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We can use a ruler to measure the sprout's height and the width of the leaves, as well as check up on </br> how many leaves does it have. That can give us a grasp of where our plant is going, and what we can do in the future for the set up.  We will share and compile this information at the end of the week, and make sure that we all follow the right set-up for our compost in each plant. 
		</p>
		<p>
			We can compile all our data at the end of the week, compare results, and create conclusions regarding the different ways we can apply our compost.
