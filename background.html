		<H2>The problem we are aiming to solve</H2>
		<p>
		The problem that we have identified in the previous quarter’s Enabling Tasks were the Madrasah Foundation’s financing issues. The organizers of this institution are the MCDPU. They aim to educate Muslim children with the “true values”, history, Arabic writing and reading, science and teachings of Islam to become a law-abiding citizen contributive to social and moral development.</p>
		<p>
		 Their ideals and mission are very much for the good of all people, yet the oversight of their financial shortcomings are something that can be a very big problem for the foundation. They may not be able to accomplish tasks they wish to do for the betterment of the people.</p>

		<h2>Our solution/Project Proposal</h2>
		<p>
		The project that our group is advocating for is donating pre-loved items to the Madrasah institute to help properly fund and aid any lacking materials & facilities/aspects. The items can vary from legitimate school materials to items being sold (both online and in in-person) with the money supporting our project. Our group will use social media platforms and our own website to promote our cause and spread awareness to the difficulties Madrasah faces, in hopes of optimizing the students’ educational environment.

          This project help us see the difficulties in life that many people experience. It also prepares us for the future to help the needed people, to never forget about them, always remember the churches teachings to always help the people who are need and suffering. This trains us to become responsible people. It also uses the skills and knowledge that we have and learned from the school.
